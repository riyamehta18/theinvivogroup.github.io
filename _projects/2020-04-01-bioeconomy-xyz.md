<a href="http://bioeconomy.xyz/" target="_blank">Bioeconomy.XYZ</a> was a project I launched at the start of the pandemic when I left my job in government. I has spent do much time talking to amazing people about their research and their companies, but I felt that there was a need to build a platform that the indiviuals who were making the magic happen could share their voices.

<a href="http://bioeconomy.xyz/" target="_blank">Bioeconomy.XYZ</a> is a publication where people can talk about the great things going on in the world and how they are working in it. It's one part about tech, another about art, and a healthy portion about careers.
