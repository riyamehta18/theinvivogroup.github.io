Hi, my name is Riya, and I’m a student at Dartmouth pursuing my Master’s in Health Data Science! I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA, and completed my BS in Biology and Quantitative Sciences from Emory University. I’m so excited to have joined In Vivo Group as a Data Scientist and am looking forward to contribute to the applications of machine learning to the field of biotechnology!

# What am I doing today?
As a student at Dartmouth, I have become increasing interested in exploring the intersection of the two fields of data science and healthcare. I currently work as Data Analysis Consultant at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center where I help analyze cancer-related clinical trial data. 

At In Vivo Group, I’m doing biostatistics work with NHANES data in Google Cloud. I’m particularly looking at the prevalence of hypertension in women of reproductive ages and looking at risk factors including underlying health conditions and race. 

# What I was up to in the past?
I spent the last year working as a Project Manager at McKesson in the pharmaceutical industry where I was exposed to and got inspired by data science in the healthcare space, pushing me to pursue my current degree. Before that, I was a Research Specialist for a Georgia Tech lab working on tissue biomanufacturing for neuroblastoma therapy research.

# How about a little fun?
I love to travel and explore different cultures around the world any chance I get! My favorite trip has been a spontaneous trip to Asia that I took after graduating from college. I spent three weeks in Amsterdam, Dubai, Delhi, Singapore, Bali, and Bangkok and loved every second of it! I’m looking forward to planning more trips in the future - Australia is hopefully next on the list.

When I’m not traveling, I like to try out new gluten-free recipes. I was diagnosed with Celiac disease a few years ago and have been making the adjustment to this new lifestyle. There are definitely a lot of foods that I miss, but luckily I’ve been able to recreate some of them!
